# SCREENS AND FACES: USING SOCIAL COHESION AND ONLINE COMMUNICATION AS PROXIES FOR LONELINESS EFFECTS ON HAPPINESS


## Thesis repository

### Introduction

This repository will be used for the completion of Michele Giunti's 2023 Master's in Public Policy. The repository will contain data, tables, and drafts of the current research.

### Details

The thesis asks the question: *what is the effect of loneliness on happiness, considering changes in the use of online communication tools?*

It does so by utilizing political and social engagement as mediators, or alternative explanations, for the effect of loneliness on happiness.

### Data

The source of the dataset used for this thesis was pulled from the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/) and the American [National Elections Study](https://electionstudies.org/), respectively pulling the 2016-2020 panel data survey from the first database, and the 2020 ANES-GSS collaboration panel from the second database. Both raw files are contained in the depository.

### Structure

The files are divided into three main sections:

1. `Source` contains the raw files and the dofile which merges the datasets.
2. `Wrangling` contains the data manipulation dofile and the RMarkdown file for the reshaping of the data and some other mixed analysis.
3. `Analysis` contains the dofile with the regressions and the latex code for the tables. Note that the table code provided does not output the polished tables but just the raw results.

Files in these subfolders may provide additional context on how to utilize their contents.

#### Paper Drafts

An additional section may be present outlining the various versions of the paper's drafts. Note that these may not be as organized as the data, but will nonetheless be provided to allow for context and disclose the thought process behind the data.
