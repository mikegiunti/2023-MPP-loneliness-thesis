# Note:

The main files are contained in the zip folders, with the anes_timeseries_2020_gss_stata_20220408.dta file being the main ANES file, while the gss2020panel_r1a.dta is the main GSS file.

To merge just run the 01_data_prep.do file.

Only the 01_ANES_GSS_merge.dta will be used from now on, while the other files are created for convenience use and further study.
